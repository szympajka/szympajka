### Hi there 👋

I am web developer mainly working on frontend 🕵️‍♂️ 

I am 25yo with first webiste coded being just 11-12yo (I just realised (literally writing this!) that I code for more than 50% of my life and I will only grow! 🤯)! 

I am coding websites continiously since 2011 👴🏼 I work for one of the best British startups - <a href="https://motorway.co.uk">Motorway</a> 🚕
